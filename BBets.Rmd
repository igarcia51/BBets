# Introduction

<!--In this section you explain what you are trying to show.  Where did the data come from?  What is the research or other question you are trying to answer?!-->

 At the first day of class there are 35 students in Math Statistics class and professor Brownlow always proposes this bet to his students "I will wager $2 to your bet of $1 that at least two people in today's class have  the same birthday.  He tells me he has made that bet 637 times so far. Where do you think his profits are? Discuss this in a markdown document
 
 
```{r}
money=vector("numeric",0)
for(i in c(1:1000)){
money[i]=(profit(35,2, 637))
}
```
 
```{r}
hist(money)
```
 
 Bronlow profits are from 200 to 375.
 
```{r}
moneysorted=sort(money)
lci=moneysorted[26]
uci=moneysorted[974]
```
 

Report git commit structure:
There are 3 questions and there should be at least 3 separate commits, at least one dealing with each of the 3 questions.
1. What are the fair odds for a bet on matching birthdays in a 35 person class.
2. For what size class is a 2:1 odds bet fair.
3. How much money would Brownlow be expected to end up with if the bets went as described.

## Our strategy is to build a Function and the use it to answer the three questions. 

The function will be given a class_size by number of students, odds, and Number_of_times brownlow made the bet.  It will give you back how much Brownlows earnings were. We will use it to answer our three questions below. If you can, improve this function by giving default values to some of its inputs. 

# In the class and payoff as described  If you highered 40 brownlow substitute teachers to do the same thing that Brownlow did then.
## what is their average earnings

 
```{r}
money=vector("numeric",0)
for(i in c(1:40)){
money[i]=(profit(35,2, 637))
}
```
 
 
```{r}
t.test(money)
print(sd(money))
```
## the standard deviation 
 
```{r}
hist(money)
```
 
## the standard deviation and a 95% confidence interval for their earnings?
 
 The 95% confidence interval for earnings is `r lci` to `r uci`
  
  
<!--Explain and display your method of coming up with a 95% confidence interval of  professor Brownlows winnings (or losings)-->


# What are the fair odds? Use manipulation of odds in the function to tune Brownlows earnings to zero. 

```{r}
money=vector("numeric",0)
for(i in c(1:200)){
money[i]=(profit(35,4.5, 637))
}
hist(money)
```

I chose a random values for the odds variable, until I got the histogram to center at zero.I started off with 1 and it was considerable low , so I chose 5 which was closer to what I wanted but still it was too high. I went to 4 which it showed me that 4.5 was the best pick. A manipulation of the odds variable to a class size of 35 with 4.5:1 odds show to give Dr. J earnings of zero.


<!--Decide on your methods:  In this section explain the approach you will take to attack the issue --- how will you decide on a likely estimate of professor Brownlow's earnings or losses after 637 bets. Also explain how you construct a 95% confidence interval about your estimate of his winnings !-->


# What size of class makes the 2:1 bet fair?  Use manipulation of number of Students to tune Brownlows earnings to zero.


```{r}
money=vector("numeric",0)
for(i in c(1:200)){
money[i]=(profit(29,2, 637))
}
hist(money)
```

The class size needs too be between  28 and 29 students with the bet being 2:1 into tune Dr. J earnings to be zero. I started at the class size of 35 which was tooo high . The next try was a class of 20 which was too low. Maneuvering between 35 and 20 with with 20,27,31,31 and finally deciding that 28 or 29 students was the number of students.

# Discussion and Conclusion

<!--Discussion and conclusion here.  If professor Brownlow is consistantly making or losing money how could he change his payout so that his profits center on zero?  Also discuss what size his class should be in order to have his current scheme balance at zero profit.!-->

At the beggining Dr. J was making about $280 with class sizes of 35 with 2:1 odds when guessing that there would be at least two students in the same class with the same birthday. When changing the odds to 4.5:1 It would leave Dr. J close to zero profit. When changing the class size together 29 or 28 students at 2:1 odds the same was true. Dr. J's profit were close to zero.
